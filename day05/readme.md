# Day 05


### Goals
* Compare day to previous day.
* Calculate the raw change and the percentage change.
* Find the date with the largest daily increase in percentage change.

### Challenges
This was straightforward. `LAG` was used to pull in the prior day data and the change and percent change calculations were easy to do after that.

### Skills Used
**WINDOW functions &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; LAG &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; ROUND**
