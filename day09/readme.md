# Day 09


### Goals
* Calculate average speed for each participant per exercise type.
* Find highest average speed for each participant.
* Select top 3 based on their highest average speed.

### Challenges
This was a relief after the prior day. After each participant's average speed was calculated, a `RANK()` window function was used to capture the highest average speed for each participant and the top 3 were kept.

### Skills Used
**AGGREGATE functions &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; RANK**
